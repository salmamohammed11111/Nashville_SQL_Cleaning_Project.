## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on 
**cleaning and preparing housing data ** from Nashville, TN for future analysis. The dataset contains real estate records including sales, land use, and property characteristics.
Using **T-SQL**, I performed end-to-end cleaning operations: fixing nulls, restructuring fields, removing duplicates, and improving data integrity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Cleaning Steps

- **Date Conversion**: Converted `SaleDate` to proper DATE format for time-based analysis.
- **Address Standardization**:
  - Filled in missing `PropertyAddress` by joining on `ParcelID`
  - Split `PropertyAddress` and `OwnerAddress` into `StreetAddress`, `City`, and `State` using `SUBSTRING`, `CHARINDEX`, and `PARSENAME`
- **Column Additions**: Added new fields like `OwnerCity`, `OwnerState`, and `OwnerStreetAddress` for structured reporting
- **Data Standardization**:
  - Transformed `SoldAsVacant` values from `Y/N` to `Yes/No`
  - Replaced all NULLs using `ISNULL` and `COALESCE` to maintain completeness
- **Duplicate Handling**:
  - Used `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY` on `ParcelID`, `OwnerName`, and `TotalValue`
  - Removed redundant rows to preserve unique transaction records
- **Data Type Fixes & Cleanup**: Dropped obsolete columns post-cleaning for optimized output

## üß† Why This Matters
Clean datasets make or break any analysis. This project demonstrates how SQL can be used not just to query data, but to **prepare it responsibly for insights**. Whether it‚Äôs for dashboards or predictive modeling, high-quality data is the foundation.
